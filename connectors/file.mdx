## How it works
The File Connector indexes user uploaded files.
    - Currently supports `.txt` files or `.zip` files containing `.txt` files.
    - Optional metadata line supports linking to other internal tools by URL

The metadata line takes the format of:
`#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"}` where `<LINK>` is replaced with a URL.

This may be something like `https://internaltool.yourcompany.com`

Example:
```
#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "https://www.danswereng.com/captcha"}
How to set up captcha
Follow the example below to set up a captcha
like you saw when you visited this page!
By including a captcha, this page is able to
prevent web scrapers from reading it.
```
As we can see, there are many web pages or internal tools that aren't directly scrape-able.
In addition to handling local file uploads, the file connector is offered as an option for these tools which may have APIs for accessing the contents.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    - No external auth flows required.
    - Admins can upload files and make them available to everyone
    - [WIP] Admins or normal users will be able to upload files via personal connectors and make them accessible for just themselves.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **File** Connector.
    2. Select a `.txt` file or a `.zip` file and click
