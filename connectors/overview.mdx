## What are Connectors
Connectors hook up Danswer to your data sources so that answers are grounded in your organization's knowledge.

### Connectors help you
- **Choose Sources** so you can include only the data you want indexed.
- **Configure Access** so Danswer can securely access data with your permission.
- **Set Up Fetching** options to keep Danswer's answers up to date.


## Monitoring Connectors
Open the `Connectors Dashboard` (accessible from the profile icon on the top right)
At the top there is a `Status` page which shows which sources have been indexed and the status of the indexing job.
